# YOLO-License-Plate-Recognition-with-TTS-Alerts
An advanced license plate recognition system that uses YOLO for real-time detection and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to alert traffic violations. This system identifies vehicle license plates, extracts text, and checks for violations. If a designated vehicle violates traffic rules, an alert is generated via TTS.
